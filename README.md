## Description

Lung cancer is a deadly disease, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to build a lung cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays or CT scans) and identify potential cancerous regions. The trained model can assist radiologists in diagnosing lung cancer at an earlier stage.

Key features of this project:

- Preprocessing of medical images to prepare data for training and evaluation.
- Training a CNN model to classify images as cancerous or non-cancerous.
- Evaluation metrics to assess the model's performance.
- User-friendly interface for running the trained model on new images.
